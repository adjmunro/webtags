# Worktree Secrets
#
# List files and patterns that should be copied to new worktrees
# Used by scripts/copy-worktree-secrets.sh
#
# Pattern types:
# 1. Glob with slash: matches full paths (e.g., native-host/**/*.key)
# 2. Glob without slash: matches basenames (e.g., *.env)
# 3. Path fragment: matches anywhere in path (e.g., config/secrets/)
# 4. Exact basename: matches filename anywhere (e.g., .env.local)

# Example patterns (uncomment and customize as needed):

# Environment files
# .env
# .env.local
# .env.production

# Configuration files
# config/secrets.json
# native-host/config/*.toml

# Private keys
# *.pem
# *.key

# GitHub tokens
# .github-token

# Local development configs
# local.properties
